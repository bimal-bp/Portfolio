## Projects

## 1.Bank-Marketing-Effectiveness-Prediction-ML-Classification
[GithubLink](https://github.com/bimal-bp/Bank-Marketing-Effectiveness-Prediction-ML-Classification)

### Business Challenge:
- This project aimed to improve the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) for a Portuguese banking institution. The goal was to predict which clients are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

### Approach:

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Cleaned the data by removing missing values and inconsistencies.
- Potentially transformed or combined some features for better analysis.

**Feature Engineering:**
- Created new features from existing ones (e.g., total contact duration) that might be more predictive.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyzed the data to understand the characteristics of clients who subscribed compared to those who didn't.
- Identified potential trends and relationships between features that could influence the likelihood of subscribing.

**Model Selection and Training:**
- Trained and evaluated different machine learning classification models on the data, including:
Logistic Regression,Random Forest,XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
- Compared the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.

**Model Tuning (Optional):**
- Potentially fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the best performing model (XGBoost) to further improve its accuracy.

**Conclusion**
-  Most term deposit subscribers are aged 30-36, with higher education and managerial jobs. Married clients are both the most and least likely to subscribe 
- The XGBoost model achieved outstanding accuracy (0.93) in predicting client subscription behavior.

## 2.MLOPS_sensor_fault_detection_END_2_end
[GithubLink](https://github.com/bimal-bp/MLOPS_sensor_fault_detection_END_2_end)

### Problem Statement:
- This project tackled the challenge of predicting failures in a truck's Air Pressure System (APS) using machine learning. The APS is crucial for various functions like braking and gear changes.

### Approach:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyzed the data to understand its characteristics and identify missing values.
Cleaned the data by removing columns with significant missing values (over 70%).

**Missing Value Imputation:**
- Compared five different techniques for imputing missing values in the remaining columns.
Selected the method that resulted in the best model performance.

**Data Balancing:**
- Employed techniques to balance the positive and negative class distributions.
This ensured the model wouldn't be biased towards the majority class.

**Model Selection and Training:**
- Evaluated and compared five different machine learning models on the balanced dataset.
- Selected the model with the best performance as Random Forest with a high accuracy and low cost  in predicting APS failures.

**Modular Coding and Deployment:**
- Implemented modular code for data processing, cleaning, pre-processing, model training, and evaluation.
- Stored the data in MongoDB Atlas for persistence and scalability.
- Developed a workflow for reading data from MongoDB, performing pre-processing and model training, and evaluating model performance.

**Dockerization and CI/CD:**
- Created a Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring consistent execution across environments.
- Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

## 5.DPO_Finetune_project
[GithubLink](https://github.com/bimal-bp/AWS_sagemaker_ml_project)

### Approach:

- **4. PEFT for Cost-Effective Quantization Fine-Tuning:**

- Problem: Fine-tuning LLMs on custom data often requires significant computational resources, making it expensive and time-consuming.
  
### **Benefits:**
  
- Lower Cost: Reduces the computational resources required for fine-tuning, leading to significant cost savings.
  
- Faster Training: Enables faster model training due to the smaller model size and reduced parameter updates.
  
- Accessibility: Makes fine-tuning LLMs more accessible for businesses with limited resources.

-  **5. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):**

-  DPO is a technique that allows you to directly guide the fine-tuning process without requiring explicit human labeling of factual correctness or specific styles.
  
-   This helps the model understand which types of responses are desirable and which ones are not.
Ranking multiple outputs: This provides the model with more nuanced feedback about the quality and style of its responses.

### **Benefits:**
  
- Improved Quality: Similar to human-in-the-loop, DPO helps achieve more accurate, reliable, and human-like outputs from the LLM.
 
- Efficiency Gains: Unlike traditional human labeling, DPO can be more efficient as it focuses on preference selection instead of detailed annotation.
  
- Scalability: DPO allows for incorporating feedback from a larger pool of people, potentially leading to faster and more robust fine-tuning.
