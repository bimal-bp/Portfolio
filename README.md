### Problem Statement:
- This project tackled the challenge of predicting failures in a truck's Air Pressure System (APS) using machine learning. The APS is crucial for various functions like braking and gear changes.

### Approach:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyzed the data to understand its characteristics and identify missing values.
Cleaned the data by removing columns with significant missing values (over 70%).

**Missing Value Imputation:**
- Compared five different techniques for imputing missing values in the remaining columns.
Selected the method that resulted in the best model performance.

**Data Balancing:**
- Employed techniques to balance the positive and negative class distributions.
This ensured the model wouldn't be biased towards the majority class.

**Model Selection and Training:**
- Evaluated and compared five different machine learning models on the balanced dataset.
- Selected the model with the best performance as Random Forest with a high accuracy and low cost  in predicting APS failures.

**Modular Coding and Deployment:**
- Implemented modular code for data processing, cleaning, pre-processing, model training, and evaluation.
- Stored the data in MongoDB Atlas for persistence and scalability.
- Developed a workflow for reading data from MongoDB, performing pre-processing and model training, and evaluating model performance.

**Dockerization and CI/CD:**
- Created a Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring consistent execution across environments.
- Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
